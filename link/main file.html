    <h2>roll</h2>
  <p>Preheat a grill to medium high. 
      Form ground beef (preferably chuck) into 6-ounce patties and make
       an indentation in each. Season the patties on both sides with salt
        and pepper. Lightly brush the grill grates with vegetable oil, 
        then grill the patties, indentation-side up, until marked on the
         bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until marked and slightly
          firm, about 3 more minutes for medium doneness. For cheese</p>
